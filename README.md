# HierarchicalSolvers.jl

Library implementing sparse direct solvers based on nested dissection reorderings. Further optimizations are implmented, including compression of Schur complements via hierarchically structured low-rank (HSS) matrices and efficient storage of Gauss transforms as low-rank matrices.
